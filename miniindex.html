        <p>The measuring of time produces anxiety when it serves to assign us to social tasks,
          but it makes us <span class="borders">feel safe</span> when it substantializes time and cuts it into slices like an object of consumption.
          Everybody knows from experience how intimate a <span class="borders">ticking clock</span> can make a place feel; the reason is that the clock’s
          sound assimilates the place to the inside of our own body.
          The clock is a <span class="borders">mechanical heart</span> that reassures us about our own heart.</p>

              a lot of <span class="borders">variations</span>. It is the proof that we are facing a material that our own experiences and feelings shape as they want,
              in (or from) which we all escape in our very own personal way. How has our relationship to time
